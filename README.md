# Python, NumPy, and Pandas Tutorial Notebooks

Welcome to my collection of Jupyter notebooks that cover a wide range of topics in Python, NumPy, and Pandas—key tools for any data scientist’s arsenal. These notebooks are companions to my YouTube tutorial series, where I dive deep into each topic to ensure you understand not just the "how," but also the "why."

## What's Inside

- **Python Basics**: Start from the ground up with variables, data types, loops, and functions.
- **NumPy Mastery**: Learn how to efficiently handle numerical data with NumPy arrays, operations, and broadcasting techniques.
- **Pandas Proficiency**: Get to grips with data manipulation and analysis using Pandas, from basic data structures to complex groupings and joins.

Each notebook is named sequentially to guide you through your learning journey.

## How to Use These Notebooks

2. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone [repository-url]`.
3. Navigate to the cloned directory.
4. Start Jupyter by running `jupyter notebook` in your terminal or command prompt.
5. Open any notebook and start coding along!
